# Revolut churn challenge

A sample churn prevention solution for an FinTech app

## Challenge

1. Define a target metric to measure user engagement. How would you define an _engaged_ vs. _unengaged_ user?
    * Please provide the business justification and associated visualisations / rationale in choosing your definition of engagement

2. Using your logic from above, build a model (heuristic/statistical/ML) to classify _engaged_ and _unengaged_ users
    * Note that features which are directly correlated with your target metric could lead to overfitting

3. Letâ€™s assume an _unengaged_ user is a churned user. Now suppose we use your model to identify unengaged users and implement some business actions try to convert them to engaged users (commonly known as reducing churn)
    * How would you set up a test/experiment to check whether we are actually reducing churn?
    * What metrics and techniques would you use to assess the impact of the business action?
